## Step 2
Many classes in Computer science use course-specific accounts. It is possible to use VScode to connect to a remote computer over the Internet to do work there.
If you’re on a computer that uses Windows operating system, you must install a program called OpenSSH, which is a program that can connect your computer to other computers that have this kind of account.
1. For the first step, open a terminal in VSCode. Your command will look like this, but with the aa replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.\ *$ ssh cs15lwi22aa@ieng6.ucsd.edu*
2. Second, you should get a message like this \ *⤇ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?* \
you will want to type **yes** to this and press enter.
