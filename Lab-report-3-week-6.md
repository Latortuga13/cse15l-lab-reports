## Creating .ssh/config file
This is my .ssh/config file
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
In order to create it, I used notepad and wrote the code used to log me into the ieng system.
## Copying a .java file into my account
This is the .ssh/config file (my alias) letting me access the ieng6 faster

<br /><br />
Because of my .ssh/config file, I am able to just use my alias instead of having to type out my whole cse15l account info when acessing ieng.

This is me copying my test.java file into the ieng6
<br /><br />

Checking to see if the files actually copied

<br />
Because the test.java file exists on the ieng6 platform, the copy was succesful.
